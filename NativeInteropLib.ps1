there is also other place it could save, possibly,

    .SYNOPSIS

    Should be called from -> Slc.dll
    but work from sppc.dll, osppc.dll
    maybe Slc.dll call sppc.dll -or osppc.dll

    Windows 10 DLL File Information - sppc.dll
    https://windows10dll.nirsoft.net/sppc_dll.html

    List of files that are statically linked to sppc.dll, 
    slc.dll, etc, etc, 
    This means that when one of the above files is loaded, 
    sppc.dll will be loaded too.
    (The opposite of the previous 'Static Linking' section)

    "OSPPC.dll" is a dynamic link library (DLL) file,
    that is a core component of Microsoft Office's Software Protection Platform.
    Essentially, it's involved in the licensing and activation of your Microsoft Office products.
    can be found under windows 7 ~ Vista, For older MSI version

    SLIsGenuineLocal, SLGetLicensingStatusInformation, SLGetWindowsInformation, SLGetWindowsInformationDWORD -> 
    is likely --> ZwQueryLicenseValue with: (Security-SPP-Action-StateData, Security-SPP-LastWindowsActivationHResult, etc)
    So, instead, use Get-ProductPolicy instead, to enum all value's

    >>> SLIsGenuineLocal function (slpublic.h)
    This function checks the **Tampered flag** of the license associated with the specified application. If the license is not valid, 
    or if the Tampered flag of the license is set, the installation is not considered valid. 

    >>> https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/api/ex/slmem/queryvalue.htm
    If the license has been **tampered with**, the function fails (returning STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR). 
    If the licensing cache is corrupt, the function fails (returning STATUS_DATA_ERROR). 
    If there are no licensing descriptors but the kernel thinks it has the licensing descriptors sorted, 
    the function fails (returning STATUS_OJBECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND). 
    If the licensing descriptors are not sorted, they have to be.

.SYNOPSIS
Manages native UNICODE_STRING memory and content for P/Invoke.

.DESCRIPTION
This function allows for the creation of new UNICODE_STRING structures,
in-place updating of existing ones, and safe release of all associated
unmanaged memory (both the structure and its internal string buffer)
using low-level NTDLL APIs.

Well-known SIDs
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/well-known-sids

The SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY (S-1-5) predefined identifier authority produces SIDs that are not universal but are meaningful only on Windows installations.
You can use the following RID values with SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY to create well-known SIDs.

SECURITY_LOCAL_SYSTEM_RID
String value: S-1-5-18
A special account used by the operating system.

The following table has examples of domain-relative RIDs that you can use to form well-known SIDs for **local groups** (aliases).
For more information about local and global groups, see Local Group Functions and Group Functions.

DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_ADMINS
Value: 0x00000220
String value: S-1-5-32-544
A local group used for administration of the domain.

You don't get Pointer to [LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY] Offset 0x0, it depend
So, you need to consider, [LinkPtr] & [+Data Offset -0x00\0x10\0x20] -> Actual Offset of Data to read

[PEB_LDR_DATA] & 0x10 -> Read Pointer -> \ List Head [LIST_ENTRY]->Flink \ -> [LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY]->[LIST_ENTRY]->0x00 [AKA] InLoadOrderLinks           [& Repeat]
[PEB_LDR_DATA] & 0x20 -> Read Pointer -> \ List Head [LIST_ENTRY]->Flink \ -> [LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY]->[LIST_ENTRY]->0x10 [AKA] InMemoryOrderLinks         [& Repeat]
[PEB_LDR_DATA] & 0x30 -> Read Pointer -> \ List Head [LIST_ENTRY]->Flink \ -> [LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY]->[LIST_ENTRY]->0x20 [AKA] InInitializationOrderLinks [& Repeat]


.........................

- (*PPEB_LDR_DATA)->InMemoryOrderModuleList -> [LIST_ENTRY] head
- each [LIST_ENTRY] contain [*flink], which point to next [LIST_ENTRY]
- [LDR_DATA_TABLE] is also [LIST_ENTRY], first offset 0x0 is [LIST_ENTRY],
  Like this -> (LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY *) = (LIST_ENTRY *)

the result of this is!
[LIST_ENTRY] head, is actually [LIST_ENTRY] And not [LDR_DATA_TABLE]
only used to start the Loop chain, to Read the next [LDR_DATA_TABLE]
and than, read next [LDR_DATA_TABLE] item from [0x0  LIST_ENTRY] InLoadOrderLinks
which is actually [0x0] flink* -> pointer to another [LDR_DATA_TABLE]

C Code ->

LIST_ENTRY* head = &Peb->Ldr->InMemoryOrderModuleList;
LIST_ENTRY* current = head->Flink;

while (current != head) {
    LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY* module = (LDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY*)current;
    wprintf(L"Loaded Module: %wZ\n", &module->FullDllName);
    current = current->Flink;
